# Workforce Pipeline Risk Forecasting System 🚀

An end-to-end **Workforce Intelligence Platform** that predicts talent shortages, hiring timelines, and skill gaps by connecting **industry trends, company behavior, and student readiness**.

This project goes beyond dashboards — it turns workforce data into **actionable decisions** for both **industries** and **job seekers**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Industries struggle to answer:
- When will we need to hire?
- Is our talent pipeline strong enough?
- Which companies will face hiring pressure first?

Students struggle to answer:
- Which industries are hiring next?
- Which companies should I target?
- How ready is my resume for future jobs?

**This system bridges that gap.**

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

The platform uses **rule-based, explainable AI logic** (not black-box models) to:

- Forecast workforce risk
- Predict hiring surge timelines
- Compare companies within an industry
- Guide students on skills, jobs, and resume readiness

> Same data. Different decisions.

## 📐 Core Logic & Formulas

### Talent Supply
Supply = Internship_Intake × Conversion_Rate


### Talent Demand
Demand = Growth_Rate + (Attrition_Rate × 1.5)


### Normalization
- Percentile-based normalization (P5–P95)
- Applied per industry
- Prevents artificial 0/100 spikes

### Workforce Risk Score
Core_Risk = (Demand_Score − Supply_Score) + (Attrition × 15)

Baseline_Risk = 5 + (Attrition × 10) + (Demand_Trend × 0.5)

Final_Risk = max(Core_Risk, Baseline_Risk)


### Hiring Pressure Index (HPI)
HPI = (Demand − Supply) + (Attrition × 20) + (Demand_Trend × 0.8)


Mapped to:
- **1–3 months** → Immediate hiring
- **4–6 months** → Near-term hiring
- **6–12 months** → Planned hiring
